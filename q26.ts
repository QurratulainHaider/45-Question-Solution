//Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.
// • If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.

// • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

// • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.





//Alien #2
let variable_alien ='green';
//if blocks runs
// if (variable_alien ==='green'){
//     console.log('player just earned 5 points for shooting he alien!')
// }

// else{
//     console.log('the player just earned 10 points')
// }

//else block runs

variable_alien = 'red'
if (variable_alien ==='green'){
    console.log('player just earned 5 points for shooting he alien!')
