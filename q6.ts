//Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. 
//Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.






//Stripping Name

let personName: string = `\n\t ASHIR HASSAN \t\n`;
console.log(personName);
let stripped: string = personName.trim();
console.log(stripped);
